            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .

Currently, data I’ve gathered is tick data downloaded during live sessions from Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE) for a dozen of instruments (mainly WIG20 stocks and futures for this index). The dataset first records have been downloaded midyear 2018. Downloading and storing the data takes place every day for a selected group of most liquid instruments on WSE. Unfortunately data set is not complete: . I’ve decided to include or exclude some instruments from downloading | Some intra-day data might be missing (Internet problems, blackouts etc.) | Some periods are missing (no data for whole day for none of the instruments) | . It is not a goal of the website to present downloading and preprocessing. On this blog, I will scratch my head about features coming from the data that has already been downloaded, stored and initially preprocessed for further analysis. .
