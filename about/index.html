<p>This website is intended to be a notebook gathering ideas connected with statistical exploration of the limit order book properties. Currently, data I’ve gathered is tick data downloaded during live sessions from Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE) for a dozen of instruments (mainly WIG20 stocks and futures for this index). The dataset first records have been downloaded midyear 2018. Downloading and storing the data takes place every day for a selected group of most liquid instruments on WSE. Unfortunately data set is not complete:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I’ve decided to include or exclude some instruments from downloading</li>
  <li>Some intra-day data might be missing (Internet problems, blackouts etc.)</li>
  <li>Some periods are missing (no data for whole day for none of the instruments)</li>
</ul>

<p>It is not a goal of the website to present downloading and preprocessing. On this blog, I will scratch my head about features coming from the data that has already been downloaded, stored and initially preprocessed for further analysis.</p>
